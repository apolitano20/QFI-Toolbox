%%  TENSORSUM  Computes a vector or operator from its tensor decomposition
%   This function can be called in two ways:
%   TS = TensorSum(A1,A2,...)
%   TS = TensorSum(S,A1,A2,...)
%
%   Each term Ai is either a matrix or a cell containing matrices (and they
%   should all be the same: either all matrices or all cells). If they are
%   matrices, then the k-th column of each Ai will be tensored together for
%   all k, and then the sum over k will be taken at the end. If they are
%   cells, then the k-th element of each Ai will be tensored together for
%   all k, and then the sum over k will be taken at the end.
%
%   If S is provided, it is a vector of weights (such as Schmidt
%   coefficients) that will be applied when summing the terms at the end of
%   the computation.
%
%   This function acts as an inverse of the SchmidtDecomposition and
%   OperatorSchmidtDecomposition functions. For example, if [S,U,V] =
%   SchmidtDecomposition(VEC) then VEC = TensorSum(S,U,V).
