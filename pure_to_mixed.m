%%  pure_to_mixed    Converts a state vector or density matrix representation of a state to a density matrix
%   This function has one required argument:
%     PHI: a density matrix or a pure state vector
%
%   RHO = pure_to_mixed(PHI) is a density matrix representation of PHI,
%   regardless of whether PHI is itself already a density matrix, or if it
%   is a pure state vector.
